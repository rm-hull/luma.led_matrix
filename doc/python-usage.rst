Python Usage
------------

8x8 LED Matrices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For the matrix device, initialize the :py:class:`luma.led_matrix.device.max7219`
class, as follows:

.. code:: python

   from luma.core.interface.serial import spi, noop
   from luma.core.render import canvas
   from luma.led_matrix.device import max7219
   
   serial = spi(port=0, device=0, gpio=noop())
   device = max7219(serial)

The display device should now be configured for use. The specific
:py:class:`~luma.led_matrix.device.max7219` class  exposes a
:py:func:`~luma.led_matrix.device.max7219.display` method which takes an image
with attributes consistent with the capabilities of the configured device's
capabilities. However, for most cases, for drawing text and graphics primitives,
the canvas class should be used as follows:

.. code:: python

   font = ImageFont.truetype("examples/pixelmix.ttf", 8)
 
   with canvas(device) as draw:
       draw.rectangle(device.bounding_box, outline="white", fill="black")

The :py:class:`luma.core.render.canvas` class automatically creates an
:py:mod:`PIL.ImageDraw` object of the correct dimensions and bit depth suitable
for the device, so you may then call the usual Pillow methods to draw onto the
canvas.

As soon as the with scope is ended, the resultant image is automatically
flushed to the device's display memory and the :mod:`PIL.ImageDraw` object is
garbage collected.

.. note::
   The default Pillow font is too big for 8px high devices like the LED matrices
   here, so the `luma.examples <https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.examples>`_ repo
   inclues a small TTF pixel font called **pixelmix.ttf** (attribution: 
   http://www.dafont.com/) which just fits.

   Alternatively, a set of "legacy" fixed-width bitmap fonts are included in
   the `luma.core <https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.core>`__ codebase and may be
   used as follows:

   .. code:: python

     from luma.core import legacy
     from luma.core.legacy.font import proportional, CP437_FONT, LCD_FONT

     with canvas(device) as draw:
        legacy.text(draw, (0, 0), "A", fill="white", font=proportional(CP437_FONT))

   The fixed-width fonts can be "converted" on-the-fly to proportionally
   spaced by wrapping them with the :py:class:`luma.core.legacy.font.proportional` 
   class.

Scrolling / Virtual viewports
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
A single 8x8 LED matrix clearly hasn't got a lot of area for displaying useful
information. Obviously they can be daisy-chained together to provide a longer
line of text, but as this library extends `luma.core <https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.core>`_,
then we can use the :py:class:`luma.core.virtual.viewport` class to allow
scrolling support:

.. code:: python

   import time

   from luma.core.interface.serial import spi, noop
   from luma.core.render import canvas
   from luma.core.virtual import viewport
   from luma.led_matrix.device import max7219
   
   serial = spi(port=0, device=0, gpio=noop())
   device = max7219(serial)
   
   virtual = viewport(device, width=200, height=100)

   with canvas(virtual) as draw:
       draw.rectangle(device.bounding_box, outline="white", fill="black")
       draw.text((3, 3), "Hello world", fill="white")

   for offset in range(8):
       virtual.set_position((offset, offset))
       time.sleep(0.1)

Calling :py:meth:`~luma.core.virtual.viewport.set_position` on a virtual
viewport, causes the device to render what is visible at that specific
position; altering the position in a loop refreshes every time it is called,
and gives an animated scrolling effect.

By altering both the X and Y co-ordinates allows scrolling in any direction,
not just horizontally.

Color Model
"""""""""""
Any of the standard :mod:`PIL.ImageColor` color formats may be used, but since
the 8x8 LED Matrices are monochrome, only the HTML color names :py:const:`"black"` and
:py:const:`"white"` values should really be used; in fact, by default, any value
*other* than black is treated as white. The :py:class:`luma.core.render.canvas`
constructor does have a :py:attr:`dither` flag which if set to
:py:const:`True`, will convert color drawings to a dithered monochrome effect.

.. code:: python

  with canvas(device, dither=True) as draw:
      draw.rectangle(device.bounding_box, outline="white", fill="red")

Landscape / Portrait Orientation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
By default, cascaded matrices will be oriented in landscape mode. Should you
have an application that requires the display to be mounted in a portrait
aspect, then add a :py:attr:`rotate=N` parameter when creating the device:

.. code:: python

  from luma.core.interface.serial import i2c
  from luma.core.render import canvas
  from luma.oled.device import ssd1306, ssd1325, ssd1331, sh1106

  serial = i2c(port=1, address=0x3C)
  device = ssd1306(serial, rotate=1)

  # Box and text rendered in portrait mode
  with canvas(device) as draw:
      draw.rectangle(device.bounding_box, outline="white", fill="black")

*N* should be a value of 0, 1, 2 or 3 only, where 0 is no rotation, 1 is
rotate 90° clockwise, 2 is 180° rotation and 3 represents 270° rotation.

The :py:attr:`device.size`, :py:attr:`device.width` and :py:attr:`device.height`
properties reflect the rotated dimensions rather than the physical dimensions.

Daisy-chaining
""""""""""""""
The MAX7219 chipset supports a serial 16-bit register/data buffer which is
clocked in on pin DIN every time the clock edge falls, and clocked out on DOUT
16.5 clock cycles later. This allows multiple devices to be chained together.

If you have more than one device and they are daisy-chained together, you can
initialize the library in one of two ways, either using :py:attr:`cascaded=N` 
to indicate the number of daisychained devices:

.. code:: python

   from luma.core.interface.serial import spi, noop
   from luma.core.render import canvas
   from luma.led_matrix.device import max7219

   serial = spi(port=0, device=0, gpio=noop())
   device = max7219(serial, cascaded=3)

   with canvas(device) as draw:
      draw.rectangle(device.bounding_box, outline="white", fill="black")

Using :py:attr:`cascaded=N` implies there are N devices arranged linearly and
horizontally, running left to right.

Alternatively, the device configuration may configured with :py:attr:`width=W`
and :py:attr:`height=H`. These dimensions denote the number of LEDs in the all
the daisychained devices. The width and height *must* both be multiples of 8:
this has scope for arranging in blocks in, say 3x3 or 5x2 matrices (24x24 or
40x16 pixels, respectively).

Given 12 daisychained MAX7219's arranged in a 4x3 layout, the simple example
below,

.. code:: python

   from luma.core.interface.serial import spi, noop
   from luma.core.render import canvas
   from luma.led_matrix.device import max7219
   from luma.core.legacy.font import proportional, LCD_FONT

   serial = spi(port=0, device=0, gpio=noop(), block_orientation=-90)
   device = max7219(serial, width=32, height=24)

   with canvas(device) as draw:
      draw.rectangle(device.bounding_box, outline="white")
      text(draw, (2, 2), "Hello", fill="white", font=proportional(LCD_FONT))
      text(draw, (2, 10), "World", fill="white", font=proportional(LCD_FONT))

displays as:

.. image:: images/box_helloworld.jpg
   :alt: box helloworld


Trouble-shooting / common problems
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Some online retailers are selling pre-assembled `'4-in-1' LED matrix displays
<http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/371306583204>`_, but they appear to be wired 90°
out-of-phase such that horizontal scrolling appears as below:

.. image:: images/block_reorientation.gif
   :alt: block alignment

This can be rectified by initializing the :py:class:`~luma.led_matrix.device.max7219`
device with a parameter of :py:attr:`block_orientation=-90` (or +90, if your device is
aligned the other way):

.. code:: python

   from luma.core.interface.serial import spi, noop
   from luma.core.render import canvas
   from luma.led_matrix.device import max7219

   serial = spi(port=0, device=0, gpio=noop())
   device = max7219(serial, cascaded=4, block_orientation=-90)

Every time a display render is subsequenly requested, the underlying image
representation is corrected to reverse the 90° phase shift.

7-Segment LED Displays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For the 7-segment device, initialize the :py:class:`luma.core.virtual.sevensegment` 
class, and wrap it around a previously created :py:class:`~luma.led_matrix.device.max7219`
device:

.. code:: python
    
   from luma.core.interface.serial import spi, noop
   from luma.core.render import canvas
   from luma.core.virtual import sevensegment
   from luma.led_matrix.device import max7219

   serial = spi(port=0, device=0, gpio=noop())
   device = max7219(serial, cascaded=2)
   seg = sevensegment(device)

The **seg** instance now has a :py:attr:`~luma.core.virtual.sevensegment.text` 
property which may be assigned, and when it does will update all digits
according to the limited alphabet the 7-segment displays support. For example,
assuming there are 2 cascaded modules, we have 16 character available, and so
can write:

.. code:: python

   seg.text = "Hello world"

Rather than updating the whole display buffer, it is possible to update
'slices', as per the below example:

.. code:: python

   seg.text[0:5] = "Goodbye"

This replaces ``Hello`` in the previous example, replacing it with ``Gooobye``.
The usual python idioms for slicing (inserting / replacing / deleteing) can be
used here, but note if inserted text exceeds the underlying buffer size, a
:py:exc:`ValueError` is raised.

Floating point numbers (or text with '.') are handled slightly differently - the
decimal-place is fused in place on the character immediately preceding it. This
means that it is technically possible to get more characters displayed than the
buffer allows, but only because dots are folded into their host character

WS2812 NeoPixels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For a strip of neopixels, initialize the :py:class:`luma.led_matrix.device.ws2812`
class (also aliased to  :py:class:`luma.led_matrix.device.neopixel`), supplying a
parameter :py:attr:`cascaded=N` where *N* is the number of daisy-chained LEDs.

This script creates a drawing surface 100 pixels long, and lights up three specific 
pixels, and a contiguous block:

.. code:: python

   from luma.core.render import canvas
   from luma.led_matrix.device import ws2812
   
   device = ws2812(cascaded=100)

   with canvas(device) as draw:
       draw.point((0,0), fill="white")
       draw.point((4,0), fill="blue")
       draw.point((11,0), fill="orange")
       draw.rectange((20, 0, 40, 0), fill="red")

If you have a device like Pimoroni's `Unicorn pHat <https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-phat>`_, 
initialize the device with :py:attr:`width=N` and :py:attr:`height=N` attributes instead:

.. code:: python

   from luma.core.render import canvas
   from luma.led_matrix.device import ws2812
   
   # Pimoroni's Unicorn pHat is 8x4 neopixels
   device = ws2812(width=8, height=4)

   with canvas(device) as draw:
       draw.line((0, 0, 0, device.height), fill="red")
       draw.line((1, 0, 1, device.height), fill="orange")
       draw.line((2, 0, 2, device.height), fill="yellow")
       draw.line((3, 0, 3, device.height), fill="green")
       draw.line((4, 0, 4, device.height), fill="blue")
       draw.line((5, 0, 5, device.height), fill="indigo")
       draw.line((6, 0, 6, device.height), fill="violet")
       draw.line((7, 0, 7, device.height), fill="white")

.. note::
   The ws2812 driver uses the `ws2812 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ws2812>`_
   PyPi package to interface to the daisychained LEDs. It uses DMA (direct memory
   access) via ``/dev/mem`` which means that it has to run in privileged mode
   (via ``sudo`` root access).

The same viewport, scroll support, portrait/landscape orientation and color model
idioms provided in luma.core are equally applicable to the ws2812 implementation.

Pimoroni Unicorn HAT
""""""""""""""""""""
Pimoroni sells the `Unicorn HAT <https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-hat>`_, 
comprising 64 WS2812b NeoPixels in an 8x8 arrangement. The pixels are cascaded, but
arranged in a 'snake' layout, rather than a 'scan' layout. In order to accomodate this,
a translation mapping is required, as follows:

.. code:: python

    import time

    from luma.led_matrix.device import ws2812, UNICORN_HAT
    from luma.core.render import canvas

    device = ws2812(width=8, height=8, mapping=UNICORN_HAT)

    for y in range(device.height):
        for x in range(device.width):
            with canvas(device) as draw:
                draw.point((x, y), fill="green")
            time.sleep(0.5)

This should animate a green dot moving left-to-right down each line.

NeoSegments (WS2812)
""""""""""""""""""""
`@msurguy <https://twitter.com/msurguy?lang=en>`_ has `crowdsourced some WS2812 neopixels <https://www.crowdsupply.com/maksmakes/neosegment>`_ 
into a modular 3D-printed seven-segment unit. To program these devices:

.. code:: python

    import time

    from luma.led_matrix_device import neosegment

    neoseg = neosegment(width=6)
    
    # Defaults to "white" color initially
    neoseg.text = "NEOSEG"
    time.sleep(1)

    # Set the first char ('N') to red
    neoseg.color[0] = "red"
    time.sleep(1)

    # Set fourth and fifth chars ('S','E') accordingly
    neoseg.color[3:5] = ["cyan", "blue"]
    time.sleep(1)

    # Set the entire string to green
    neoseg.color = "green"

The :py:class:`~luma.led_matrix.device.neosegment` class extends :py:class:`~luma.core.virtual.sevensegment`,
so the same text assignment (Python slicing paradigms) can be used here as well -
see the earlier section for further details.

The underlying device is exposed as attribute :py:attr:`device`, so methods
such as :py:attr:`show`, :py:attr:`hide` and :py:attr:`contrast` are available.

Next-generation APA102 NeoPixels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
APA102 RGB neopixels are easier to control that WS2812 devices - they are driven
using SPI rather than precise timings that the WS2812 devices need. Initialize the
:py:class:`luma.led_matrix.device.apa102` class, supplying a parameter
:py:attr:`cascaded=N` where *N* is the number of daisy-chained LEDs. 

The following script creates a drawing surface 8 pixels long, and lights up three 
specific pixels:

.. code:: python

   from luma.core.render import canvas
   from luma.led_matrix.device import apa102
   
   device = apa102(cascaded=8)

   with canvas(device) as draw:
       draw.point((0,0), fill="white")
       draw.point((0,1), fill="blue")
       draw.point((0,2), fill=(0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0x80))  # RGBA tuple, alpha controls brightness

APA102 RGB pixels can have their brightness individually controlled: by setting
the alpha chanel to a translucent value (as per the above example) will set the 
brightness accordingly.

Emulators
^^^^^^^^^
There are various `display emulators <http://github.com/rm-hull/luma.emulator>`_
available for running code against, for debugging and screen capture functionality:

* The :py:class:`luma.emulator.device.capture` device will persist a numbered
  PNG file to disk every time its :py:meth:`~luma.emulator.device.capture.display`
  method is called.

* The :py:class:`luma.emulator.device.gifanim` device will record every image
  when its :py:meth:`~luma.emulator.device.gifanim.display` method is called,
  and on program exit (or Ctrl-C), will assemble the images into an animated
  GIF.

* The :py:class:`luma.emulator.device.pygame` device uses the :py:mod:`pygame`
  library to render the displayed image to a pygame display surface. 

Invoke the demos with::

  $ python examples/clock.py -d capture --transform=led_matrix

or::

  $ python examples/clock.py -d pygame --transform=led_matrix
  
.. note::
   *Pygame* is required to use any of the emulated devices, but it is **NOT**
   installed as a dependency by default, and so must be manually installed
   before using any of these emulation devices (e.g. ``pip install pygame``).
   See the install instructions in `luma.emulator  <http://github.com/rm-hull/luma.emulator>`_
   for further details.
