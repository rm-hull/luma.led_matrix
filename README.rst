Python library interfacing LED matrix displays with the MAX7219 driver (using
SPI) and WS2812 & APA102 NeoPixels on the Raspberry Pi and other linux-based
single board computers - it provides a Pillow-compatible drawing canvas, and
other functionality to support:

* multiple cascaded devices
* LED matrix, seven-segment and NeoPixel variants
* scrolling/panning capability,
* terminal-style printing,
* state management,
* dithering to monochrome,
* pygame emulator,
* Python 2.7 and 3.4+ are both supported

A LED matrix can be acquired for a few pounds from outlets
like `Banggood <http://www.banggood.com/MAX7219-Dot-Matrix-Module-DIY-Kit-SCM-Control-Module-For-Arduino-p-72178.html?currency=GBP>`_.
Likewise 7-segment displays are available from `Ali-Express
<http://www.aliexpress.com/item/MAX7219-Red-Module-8-Digit-7-Segment-Digital-LED-Display-Tube-For-Arduino-MCU/1449630475.html>`_
or `Ebay <http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/172317726225>`_.

Breaking changes
----------------
Version 0.3.0 was released on 19 January 2017: this came with a rename of the
github project from **max7219** to **luma.led_matrix** to reflect the changing
nature of the codebase.

There is no direct migration path, but the old `docs <https://max7219.readthedocs.io>`_
and `PyPi packages <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/max7219>`_ will remain
available indefinitely, but that deprecated codebase will no longer recieve 
updates or fixes.

The consequence is that any existing code that uses the old **max7219** package
should probably be updated.
